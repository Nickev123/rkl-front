          The core gameplay of the Rumble Kong League will evolve around
          exciting 3 versus 3 basketball matches, combining proven gameplay- and
          play-to-earn mechanics. Compete with and against other real users and
          their NFTs in various leagues and compete for a range of rewards and
          become the best of your class. In order to participate in Leagues,
          users will need to be members of Clubs, a separate layer of the
          ecosystem, giving users the chance to manage their own team and find
          the best possible kong synergies to be victorious.

          Making a game is easy. Making a good game is hard. This is why the
          initial drop of 10.000 Kongs will help fund the project, planned to be
          released later in 2021 globally. Kong owners will have a say in our
          roadmap, follow us on this journey, and be the first to get their
          hands on the game.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Kongs will always be at the heart of the Rumble Kong League, it is
          our vision to open the league up to other NFT Collections in the
          future, giving NFT interoperability a new meaning and offering new
          ways to use NFTs to anyone. We are already in discussion with multiple
          known NFT Collections, some of which will be announced in the coming
          weeks.
